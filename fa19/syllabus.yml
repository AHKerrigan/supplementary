      We'll be covering the foundational mathematics for Machine Learning, spanning
      Multivariate Calculus to Linear Algebra, with a sprinkling of Statistics.
      Followed by coverage of fundamental programming ideas for Data Science, Machine
      Learning, and generally intelligence research and engineering.

      In this supplmentary workshop we will be taking a dive into different datasets that shows how machine learning
      can directly help people. This is a full hands on workshop where we will together work in
      analyzing our data, building our dataloaders and finally our models together. Come
      and help create the future!

      Getting into research can be intimidating. This meeting, we'll give you an
      overview of what grad school is like, what's involved in a PhD, what research is,
      how to narrow in on a research field, and finish off with where you can go to do
      research along with getting into those places.
