    description: 'Data science is grounded in statistics, and to make sense of your data before predicting
    with any model requires some statistical analysis and lots of charts. The huge portion of time and 
    resources for building a model isn't the model or training, but the data preparation and cleaning.
    How do we clean data? Make meaningful observations? Create graphs that represent data trends?
    The answer to these questions is highly sort after in all fields, so learning the basics
    here is a great start to your future in AI and Data Science!'
